  <h1><center>Net Neutrality Position</center></h1>
  <h2><center>By Tahmid Muttaki</center></h2>
  
  <h3> Introduction </h3>
  <p>
    The concept of Internet service providers providing all content and applications regardless 
    of the source, and without any kind of discrimination to any particular product or website is
    called net neutrality. This is a complex issue and is related with social, political ethical 
    and historical contexts. In this article, I am going to describe some concepts related to net 
    neutrality, some of the common ways of hindering net neutrality , discuss some political positions
    regarding net neutrality, give an overview of some important figures and cases related to net
    neutrality and lastly discuss the ethical implications of this concept.

  <h4>Common Carrier</h4>
  <p>
    A common carrier, in telecommunications, is an entity that provides wired and wireless
   communication services to the general public for a fee. A common carrier can be contrasted 
   with a contract carrier, also called a private carrier, which provides services to a limited
   number of customers.<br>

    Because common carriers serve the general public, they are licensed by a regulatory body.
    In the United States, the common carrier designation made by the Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC), under authorization of the Telecommunications Act of 1934. One reason
    common carriers are licensed is to ensure they provide indiscriminate public access and
    protect the privacy of the general public. Whether or not the FCC has the legal right to
    declare that internet service providers (ISPs) are common carriers is a major consideration
    in the net neutrality debate. [1]
  </p>
  <h4>Communication Service vs. Utility</h4>
  <p>
    So to ensure net neutrality by law, it boils down to whether internet is defined as a common
   carrier or not. In 2002, the Federal communications Commission classified broadband internet 
    providers as Information Services (Title I) which allowed relaxed regulations of the internet.
    But in 2015, Tom Wheeler, chairman of FCC reclassified broadband providers as a public utility 
    under Title II to enforce open internet order and net neutrality. So the debate becomes whether 
    broadband should be considered as a communication service or utility. There are several interesting 
    cases regarding this which will be discussed below.

  <h3>2. Types of neutrality and control</h3>
    <p>
     Before we go into the debate on internet regulation, let us first see how the internet can be
     controlled. Some of the common ways are traffic shaping, blocking p2p file sharing, data discrimination
     by protocol, peering etc. I am going to discuss two of these methods below:
    </p>
    <h4>Traffic shaping</h4>
    <p>
      Traffic shaping, also known as "packet shaping," is the practice of regulating network data
      transfer to assure a certain level of performance, quality of service (QoS) or return on
      investment (ROI). The practice involves delaying the flow of packets that have been designated
      as less important or less desired than those of prioritized traffic streams.[2]
    </p>
    <h4>Blocking P2P file sharing</h4>
    <p>
      P2P file sharing is a technology for efficient sharing of data between peers across the
      Internet. Just as with any other technology for transferring files, P2P file sharing can be
      used for sharing lawful as well as unlawful content. There is a great deal of lawful content,
      such as open-licensed software and digital media, that can be downloaded through P2P file
      sharing. The reason many ISPs block P2P traffic is because more than half of the traffic on the
      Internet is P2P traffic and a small group of active P2P users can typically use up the majority
      of an ISPs available bandwidth. [3]
