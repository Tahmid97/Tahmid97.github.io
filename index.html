  <h1><center>Net Neutrality Position</center></h1>
  <h2><center>By Tahmid Muttaki</center></h2>
  
  <h3> Introduction </h3>
  <p>
    The concept of Internet service providers providing all content and applications regardless 
    of the source, and without any kind of discrimination to any particular product or website is
    called net neutrality. This is a complex issue and is related with social, political ethical 
    and historical contexts. In this article, I am going to describe some concepts related to net 
    neutrality, some of the common ways of hindering net neutrality , discuss some political positions
    regarding net neutrality, give an overview of some important figures and cases related to net
    neutrality and lastly discuss the ethical implications of this concept.

  <h4>Common Carrier</h4>
  <p>
    A common carrier, in telecommunications, is an entity that provides wired and wireless
   communication services to the general public for a fee. A common carrier can be contrasted 
   with a contract carrier, also called a private carrier, which provides services to a limited
   number of customers.<br>

    Because common carriers serve the general public, they are licensed by a regulatory body.
    In the United States, the common carrier designation made by the Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC), under authorization of the Telecommunications Act of 1934. One reason
    common carriers are licensed is to ensure they provide indiscriminate public access and
    protect the privacy of the general public. Whether or not the FCC has the legal right to
    declare that internet service providers (ISPs) are common carriers is a major consideration
    in the net neutrality debate. [1]
  </p>
  <h4>Communication Service vs. Utility</h4>
  <p>
    So to ensure net neutrality by law, it boils down to whether internet is defined as a common
   carrier or not. In 2002, the Federal communications Commission classified broadband internet 
    providers as Information Services (Title I) which allowed relaxed regulations of the internet.
    But in 2015, Tom Wheeler, chairman of FCC reclassified broadband providers as a public utility 
    under Title II to enforce open internet order and net neutrality. So the debate becomes whether 
    broadband should be considered as a communication service or utility. There are several interesting 
    cases regarding this which will be discussed below.

  <h3>2. Types of neutrality and control</h3>

    <p>
     Before we go into the debate on internet regulation, let us first see how the internet can be
     controlled. Some of the common ways are traffic shaping, blocking p2p file sharing, data discrimination
     by protocol, peering etc. I am going to discuss two of these methods below:
    </p>
    <h4>Traffic shaping</h4>
    <p>
      Traffic shaping, also known as "packet shaping," is the practice of regulating network data
      transfer to assure a certain level of performance, quality of service (QoS) or return on
      investment (ROI). The practice involves delaying the flow of packets that have been designated
      as less important or less desired than those of prioritized traffic streams.[2]
    </p>
    <h4>Blocking P2P file sharing</h4>
    <p>
      P2P file sharing is a technology for efficient sharing of data between peers across the
      Internet. Just as with any other technology for transferring files, P2P file sharing can be
      used for sharing lawful as well as unlawful content. There is a great deal of lawful content,
      such as open-licensed software and digital media, that can be downloaded through P2P file
      sharing. The reason many ISPs block P2P traffic is because more than half of the traffic on the
      Internet is P2P traffic and a small group of active P2P users can typically use up the majority
      of an ISPs available bandwidth. [3] 
    </p>
  
  
  <h3>3. Political viewpoints</h3>
    <p>
      The net neutrality issue can be considered differently according to the different social and 
      economic structures. Some prominent social and economic positions are: neo-liberalism, conservatism, 
      libertarianism, laissez-faire capitalism, free market economy etc. I am going to discuss two 
      of these political standpoints and see how the net neutrality issue is interpreted in the two 
      socio-economic structure. 
    </p>
    <h4>Neo-liberalism</h4>
      <p>
        Neoliberalism is a term for different social and economic ideas. Originally the term was used
        by a group of liberals who helped shape social market economy in the mid-20th century.
        Neoliberalism is characterized by free market trade, deregulation of financial markets,
        individualisation, and the shift away from state welfare provision. Increasingly, the market
        fails to yield fair or equitable outcomes. In the application of neoliberal ideals, the state
        might also intervene and regulate, for example, to prevent exploitation, or to ensure social
        fairness and equality. [4]<br>
        So in this standpoint, the govenrment has the right to regulate internet service providers and
        put laws so that net neutrality is achieved.
      </p>
    <h4>Laissez-faire capitalism</h4>
    <center><img src = "econ.jpg" width="400" height="400">
    <p><b>Source: </b>https://marketbusinessnews.com/financial-glossary/laissez-faire-definition-meaning/</p></center>
      <p>
        Laissez-faire economics is a theory that restricts government intervention in the economy.
        It holds that the economy is strongest when all the government does is protect individuals'
        rights. Laissez-faire is French for "let do." In other words, let the market do its own thing.
        If left alone, the laws of supply and demand will efficiently direct the production of goods
        and services. Supply includes natural resources, capital, and labor. Demand includes purchases
        by consumers, businesses, and the government. [5]
        So it is seen that, Laissez-faire economy doesn't support government regulation on internet
        service providers. It is the markets decision to find out if net neutrality is necessary or not.

  <h3>4. Key figures</h3>
    <h4>Ajit Pai: Anti Net Neutrality</h4>
    <p>
      Ajit Pai was named FCC chairman in 2017, shortly into the start of the Trump administration,
      and he quickly made it a goal to reverse the net neutrality rules passed in 2015. Here is a
      video that explains his reasons to make ISPs Title I and reverse the net neutrality rules.

    <h4>Tom Wheeler: Pro Net Neutrality</h4>
    <p>
      President Barack Obama appointed Tom Wheeler as chair of the Federal Communications Commission
      in 2013. On his watch, the FCC passed the Open Internet Order that established net neutrality
      and reclassified broadband internet providers as "common carriers" similar to landline and
      cellular phone providers. Wheeler had spent time during the 1980s as CEO of a tech startup called NABU,
      which offered an AOL-like home computer networking service that used cable television lines.
      That experience helped him understand the importance of open networks.[6]
